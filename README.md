# Introduction to HDM
Hybrid CloudData Management (HDM) decouples compute (Virtual Machines - VM) and storage (Virtual Disks - VMDK) functions to move
workloads to public clouds faster and more efficiently. The prevalent solutions require the full replication of data to the On-Cloud, and the loss of enterprise data control is a major concern. By contrast, HDM identifies the frequently used data (hot dataset) and moves only the minimal hot data to the On-Cloud to bring up workloads within minutes.


## HDM Use Cases
Following workflows are supported by HDM
1. Agile Rapid Migration : The capability to decouple compute from data, makes HDM a powerful VM migration tool with minimal downtime requirements.
1. Try Before Commit : Another key use case is to quickly test the VMs running on On-Cloud, before fully committing to On-Cloud, termed as Try Before Commit.
1. Cold Migration : The application data is moved on to the On-Cloud byHDM through a process termed as bulk migration
