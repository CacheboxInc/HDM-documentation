If you are evaluating the HDM technology, the collection of resources in this section will enable you to quickly setup a sandbox environment where you can deploy the HDM product play with it to understand the functionality and features. The "Hands on Labs" will detail the environment you need to setup and a simple flow of a cold migration.

There are two Hands on Labs guides in the enclosed section. Choose the environment you would like to setup your sandbox environment.

* IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared (VCD)
* IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Dedicated (VCS)

If you are ready to deploy HDM into your environment, use one of the deployment guides listed below that matches your environment:
