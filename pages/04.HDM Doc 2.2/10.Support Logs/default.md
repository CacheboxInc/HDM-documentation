If you require technical support for HDM, you will need to provide the HDM support logs and VMware support logs from the deployed system. The collected logs must be provided to HDM support, along with a description of the issue.

# Support and Contact 

HDM support can be reached via **email: [support@primaryio.com](mailto:support@primaryio.com)**

The email should include the following information:

*   **Email subject **: Clearly specify the issue.
*   **Email body**: Clearly describe the problem. Include information on the deployment type, the operation being performed, any relevant screenshots, etc.
*   **Email attachment** : Attach the relevant logs (as described in [HDM Support Logs](http://docs.primaryio.com/hdm%20documentation/support%20logs) section)
    *   HDM logs
    *   vm-support logs
    *   Fill and attach the incident reporting template [HDM Incident Reporting Template.docx](../HDM%20Incident%20Reporting%20Template.docx).

    If the attachment size is too large, an alternate shared location may be provided by HDM support to enable the logs to be uploaded.
