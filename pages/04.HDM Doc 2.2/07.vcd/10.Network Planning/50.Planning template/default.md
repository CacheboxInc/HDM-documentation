title: Planning Templates
---

To make the task of planning your network easier we have created two simple templates
which will make it easier to allocate and select the network resources that will be 
required during the various phases of the deployment.

As covered in the earlier sections the **single network** which is the non-segregated 
network. The other is the **multi network** or the segregated network configuration. 

If the non-segregated network is how your premise network is configured please follow the **single network** template in the sub-section.

If you have a fully segregated network with isolation between networks please follow the 
**multi network** template.
