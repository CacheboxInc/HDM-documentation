# About This Guide

This quick start guide is intended to help you rapidly deploy PrimaryIO HDM to a test environment. The steps are intended for a single on-premises network environment, with cloud access via a WAN link and no separation of the management and VM network. All IP assignments in this guide are static/static-pool and connectivity between the on-premises and cloud environments is via IPSec. For other types of network configurations, refer to the HDM 2.1 Install Guide.

HDM provides a flexible deployment model to cater to a wide range of user needs, including different use cases, performance requirements, scalability, and levels of security. The HDM 2.1 Install Guide contains full details of every deployment mode. For simplicity, this document describes an HDM deployment using the Standalone, Ultra-Lite option. This option supports all the key features of HDM and can also be used for cold migration and validation purposes.

The following steps are required to deploy HDM:

1. Review System Requirements (estimated time: 15 minutes)
1. Download PrimaryIO HDM (estimated time: 5 minutes â€“ depending on Internet speed)
1. Network Planning & Mapping (estimated time: 20 minutes)
1. Deploy the HDM Appliance (estimated time: 5 minutes)
1. Validate the Network Configuration (estimated time: 5 minutes)
1. On-premises Deployment (estimated time: 10 minutes)
1. Cloud Deployment (estimated time: 45-60 minutes)
1. Perform a Cold Migration (estimated time: dependent on VM size)
